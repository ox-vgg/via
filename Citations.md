> There was one tool I became fond of though— VGG Image Annotator (VIA) which had many great things about it (and was my inspiration), such as no setup usage (just open in the browser), worked with local files, was very fast and cross-platform. The only downside with it was no support for YOLO format (needed to write my own converting scripts). Also, I felt, navigation could be made more efficient.

> There are a lot of tools to annotate images. I ended up using VIA (VGG Image Annotator) because of its simplicity. It’s a single HTML file that you download and open in a browser. Annotating the first few images was very slow, but once I got used to the user interface, I was annotating at around an object a minute.
 
> VGG Image Annotator (VIA): Fast, light, and really well designed. This is the one I ended up using.

> The VIA tool saves the annotations in a JSON file, and each mask is a set of polygon points. I didn’t find documentation for the format, but it’s pretty easy to figure out by looking at the generated JSON.

> Thanks for developing and supporting VIA, it's the best labeling tool I've used, and several people on my team have concurred after I suggested they try it!
